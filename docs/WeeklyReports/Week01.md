## Project Title and Description
Restaurant Performance Dashboard ‚Äì a web-based system to centralize restaurant data (sales, tips, expenses, and staff performance) and generate automated weekly and monthly PDF reports for management.

---

## User Stories Completed This Week
- Created the GitHub repository and full project folder structure.
- Added `.gitignore` and `.gitkeep` files so Git tracks all required folders.
- Created main development branches: `dev`, `feature/sprint-1-setup`, and `report/week-01`.
- Planned documentation structure (`docs/ProjectReport.md`, `docs/WeeklyReports/Week01.md`).
- Agreed reporting workflow following college guidelines.

---

## User Stories Planned for Next Week
- Start Sprint 1 development: set up the .NET solution and create the first API project.
- Implement a `/health` endpoint to confirm the API and DB are alive.
- Add initial fake seed data for weekend sales and tips (busy Fri/Sat, quiet Mon).
- Write ProjectReport.md with problem statement, stakeholders, and goals.

---

## What Went Well
- Repository structure is clean and ready (backend, frontend, data, docs, ci-cd).
- Branch strategy is defined so I can work safely without breaking `main`.
- I understand the weekly reporting process and submission rules.

---

## What Didn‚Äôt Go Well / Issues Encountered
- Git didn‚Äôt detect empty folders at first, which blocked the push.
- I had to learn how to use `.gitkeep` and why `git commit` said ‚Äúnothing to commit‚Äù.
- Needed clarity on the difference between `main`, `dev`, and feature branches. Now it's clear.
