# 🍽️ Restaurant Performance Dashboard  
*A Full-Stack project by [Geison Herrera & Daniel Vega] 
**BSc in Computing – Dorset College Dublin**  

---

## 🧠 Overview  
This project aims to solve a very real problem we’ve both experienced while working in restaurants:  
managers spend hours every week collecting data from different systems (Stripe, Toast, Excel) just to understand how the business is doing.  

Our goal is to create a **Restaurant Performance Dashboard** that centralizes all the data — sales, tips, expenses, and staff performance — in one place.  
The system will automatically generate weekly and monthly **PDF reports**, helping owners and managers make faster, data-driven decisions.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** .NET 8 (C#), Entity Framework Core  
- **Frontend:** Blazor / React (TBD)  
- **Database:** SQL Server or PostgreSQL  
- **Reporting:** QuestPDF / iText7

## 💬 Notes  
This project is being developed as part of our college coursework,  
but it’s based on real experience in the restaurant industry — and we plan to make it something genuinely useful.  
We’ll be sharing weekly updates and reflections as we progress through each sprint.
